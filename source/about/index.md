<font size = 3>The Glasgow Cyber Safety Lab (CSL) is a part of the [Glasgow Cyber Defence Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchthemes/cybersecurity/) at [the School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), Scotland, UK. The GCSL is unique in the UK focusing on the cyber security of safety-critical cyber-physical systems.  Supported by a number of industrial partners we solicit realistic requirements and provide exclusive access to a set of safety-critical network infrastructures including both conventional technologies and domain-specific Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with specific setups of Industrial Control Systems (ICS).  CSL outputs have facilitated highly impactful research in securing ICS, which has shaped Scottish, UK-wide, European, and UN cyber security policies for the civil energy, nuclear, utilities and aviation industries
