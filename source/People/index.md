<font size=4>**Dr Angelos Marnerides**</font>

<font size = 3>Dr. Angelos K. Marnerides is a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow (UoG). Angelos' research revolves around applied security and resilience for Internet-enabled cyber physical systems. His research philosophy is in designing systems with strong theoretical foundations and in providing practical, data-driven implementations that are deployable in the real world. Prior to that he was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University and the founding director of the innovative Digital Infrastructure Defense (i-DID) group leading the activities of 11 researchers. His research has received significant funding from the industry (e.g., Fujitsu, BAE, Raytheon), governmental bodies (e.g., EU, IUK, EPSRC) and he has been invited to serve as an expert reviewer in grant review panels (e.g., Chilean research commission). He has been a member of the IEEE and the ACM since 2007 and served as a Technical Program Committee (TPC) member, TPC track and workshop co-chair and organiser for several top IEEE and IFIP conferences including IEEE ICC, IEEE GLOBECOM, IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE CCNC, IFIP Networking, IEEE WoWMoM, and IEEE GLOBALSIP leading him to receive IEEE ComSoc contribution awards in 2016 and 2018. He holds an MSc ('07) and PhD ('11) in Computer Science from Lancaster University and held postdoctoral and visiting researcher positions at Carnegie Mellon University (USA), University of Porto (Portugal), Lancaster University (UK) and University College London (UK).
